       <h2 id="main-content">My Story</h2>
       <p>As a kid growing up in Singapore, surrounded by people running, or doing any physical activity and tons of sports stores or athleisure stores it was almost impossible to not want to buy a pair, but that love started in 2016, when I bought my first Nike shoe, a running shoe, I used it for almost every occasion like school, outings or sports. </p>
       
       <p>The Love for sneakers got more serious when I started watching basketball and saw how shoes described a player's mentality and about them. That's when I started researching more about shoe brands and found one of my favourite brands Jordan. In 2018, I bought my first Jordan the Jordan Proto Max 720, since then I started collecting sneakers whenever possible. Slowly, my mother started supporting my vision of making a sneaker wall as a hobby, since then I've been getting sneakers for my birthday. In 2023, when sneakercon announced their first event in SEA in Singapore, I was so excited and bought the VIP tickets and went to my first ever sneakercon. It was a jaw-dropping experience since it was heaven for sneakerheads. Since then, the sneakers kept coming in and I decided to always consider fashion as a healthy obsession.</p>
